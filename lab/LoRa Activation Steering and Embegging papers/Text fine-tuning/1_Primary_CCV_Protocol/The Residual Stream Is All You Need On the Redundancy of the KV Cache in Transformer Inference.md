A B S T R A C T


The key-value (KV) cache is widely treated as essential state in transformer inference, and a large body
of work engineers policies to compress, evict, or approximate its entries. We prove that this state is
entirely redundant: keys and values at every layer are deterministic projections of the residual stream,
and recomputing them from a single residual vector per token incurs exactly zero reconstruction error,
not approximately, but bit-identically. We verify this across six models from four architecture families
(135M to 4B parameters). Cross-task residual patching at every layer produces _𝐷_ KL = 0 between
patched and original output distributions, confirming that the residual stream satisfies a Markov
property and is the sole information-carrying state. Removing the cache entirely and recomputing
from scratch yields token-identical output under greedy decoding on all models tested. We build on
this result with KV-Direct, a bounded-memory inference scheme that checkpoints residual vectors
(5 KB per token on Gemma 3-4B) instead of full KV pairs (136 KB), recomputing keys and values
on demand. Over 20 conversation turns, KV-Direct holds peak memory at 42 MB while the standard
cache grows past 103 MB. Against five eviction baselines (H2O, StreamingLLM, SnapKV, TOVA,
window-only), KV-Direct maintains 100% token match at every cache budget; all baselines degrade to
5–28%. A per-operation latency analysis shows recomputation runs up to 5× faster than reading cached
[tensors at moderate batch sizes. Code is available at https://github.com/Kaleemullahqasim/KV-Direct.](https://github.com/Kaleemullahqasim/KV-Direct)



The key-value (KV) cache is a primary memory bottleneck in large language model inference. During autoregressive decoding, the standard approach stores precomputed
keys and values for every past token at every layer. For a
4-billion parameter model, each token adds 136 KB to the
cache; a 20-turn conversation accumulates over 100 MB, and
at the 12B-parameter scale this approaches a gigabyte.
This cost has driven a large body of work on KV cache
compression: eviction policies [1, 2], quantization [3, 4],
grouped-query attention [5], and paged memory management [6]. All of these treat the KV cache as containing
information that must be preserved or approximated. This
paper challenges that assumption.
Keys and values at each layer are deterministic functions
of the residual stream: they are obtained by applying frozen
weight matrices (and, for keys, a deterministic positional rotation) to the normalised residual vector. The cache therefore
stores derived quantities rather than unique state. That this
relationship is implicit in the transformer specification has
not prevented the field from treating the cache as a primary
information store. The practical consequence has not been
systematically examined: _the_ _KV_ _cache_ _can_ _be_ _eliminated_
_entirely_ _without_ _changing_ _a_ _single_ _output_ _token_ . We verify
this empirically: under greedy decoding, generating 30 tokens with and without the cache yields 100% token identity
across all six models tested (four architecture families, 135M

to 4B parameters). The identity holds for full-attention layers
universally; for sliding-window layers, value reconstruction
remains exact while key reconstruction requires additional
position state (Section 5.1). The cache provides a speed
advantage but carries no additional information.
This redundancy extends beyond individual projections
to the full computational state. The residual stream satisfies
a Markov property: future outputs depend on the input
history only through the current residual vectors. Crosstask patching experiments confirm this at every layer, with
_𝐷_ KL = 0 _._ 0 between the patched and original output distributions (Section 3). Zero-shot HellaSwag accuracy [7] and
WikiText-2 perplexity under KV-Direct exactly match full
caching. Because the property follows from the pre-norm
transformer architecture, it holds regardless of model scale;
our experiments span 135M to 4B parameters across four
architecture families.
These results lead to a practical inference scheme. Rather
than caching K and V at every layer, the residual stream
can be checkpointed instead (one vector per token, shared
across all layers) and KV entries recomputed on demand.
Because the residual vector is shared across layers while
KV entries are per-layer, each checkpoint is substantially
smaller: on Gemma 3-4B-IT, 5 KB per token versus 136 KB
for the full KV pair (27× reduction). We call this scheme
KV-Direct and evaluate it over 20 conversation turns, where
the standard cache grows to 103 MB while KV-Direct holds
at 42 MB (2 _._ 5× peak memory reduction). A per-operation latency analysis shows that recomputing KV from checkpoints
takes 0 _._ 2–0 _._ 3× the time of reading cached tensors at 500
evicted tokens, as memory bandwidth rather than computation becomes the bottleneck. Against five eviction baselines

(H2O [1], StreamingLLM [8], SnapKV [9], TOVA [10], and
window-only eviction), KV-Direct preserves 100% token
match at every cache budget while all baselines degrade to
5–28% match with KL divergences of 7–14.
Our contributions:

**1** Empirical proof that KV cache entries are exactly reconstructible from the residual stream (zero error across
six models spanning four architecture families: LLaMA,
Qwen2, Qwen3, Gemma 3), with a precise characterisation
of the sliding-window boundary: value reconstruction is universal, while key reconstruction in window-relative RoPE
layers requires the local position index (Section 5.1).

at 90% spectral energy on Gemma 3-4B-IT) (Section 5.7).

**4** KV-Direct, a bounded-memory inference scheme that
reduces peak KV memory by 2 _._ 5× over 20 conversation
turns (103 MB → 42 MB on Gemma 3-4B-IT) while the
standard cache grows without bound, and a latency analysis
showing that per-operation KV recomputation from residual
checkpoints is up to 5× faster than reading the equivalent
cached tensors (Sections 5.5–5.6).
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.
Section 2 surveys related work across five categories of KV
cache optimization. Section 3 formalises the residual stream
hypothesis and derives the theoretical foundations for KV
reconstruction. Section 4 describes models, baselines, and
experimental settings. Section 5 answers our four research
questions with empirical evidence and discusses practical
implications. Section 6 addresses limitations and future directions.


**2.** **Related Work**


The KV cache is the primary memory bottleneck in
autoregressive transformer inference, and a large body of
work targets its reduction. Token-level eviction methods
select which entries to retain based on attention importance [1, 2, 9], attention-sink patterns [8], RNN-style state
compression [10], layer-dependent budgets [11, 12], or
query-aware and head-aware scoring [13, 14, 15, 16]. All
treat eviction as permanent information loss. Quantization
reduces the per-entry footprint through asymmetric [17],
sensitivity-weighted [18], error-decomposed [19], coupledchannel [20], or MPO-based [21] schemes (see [4] for a
survey), while low-rank methods decompose KV projections into learned factors [22], exploit the low-dimensional
structure of key vectors [23], or compute attention directly in



SVD-reduced spaces [24]. Both families introduce approximation error by design.
Architectural modifications take a different route by
sharing KV heads across query groups [25, 5], across layers [26, 27, 28], or through learned latent bottlenecks such
as DeepSeek-V2’s Multi-head Latent Attention [29], which
achieves 93.3% memory reduction by compressing KV into
a low-dimensional representation and up-projecting on demand. MiniCache [30] interpolates KV states between adjacent layers. These approaches require model retraining or
architecture changes.
Recomputation-based inference trades compute for memory without modifying the model. KVPR [31] transfers activation checkpoints between CPU and GPU and recomputes
partial KV tensors on-device. HybridServe [32] adaptively
balances caching against on-the-fly reconstruction. FlashAttention [33, 34] recomputes intermediate attention matrices within fused kernels, and gradient checkpointing [35]
applies the same principle during training. KVPR and HybridServe are the most closely related systems, but neither
formalises a zero-information-loss guarantee nor identifies
the sliding-window boundary where exact reconstruction
breaks down.
On the theoretical side, the circuits framework [36] treats
the residual stream as a shared communication channel
between attention and MLP blocks. Induction head analysis [37] established that structured information flows through
this channel across positions and layers. Shai et al. [38]
proved that belief states are linearly encoded in the residual
stream, He et al. [39] showed that 50% of attention computation can be pruned without affecting outputs, and causal intervention methods [40, 41] provided the activation-patching
methodology we build on. This prior work uses the residual
stream to explain what transformers compute; we use it
to eliminate redundant state and build a bounded-memory
inference scheme that preserves exact output fidelity.


**3.** **Method**


We work with the standard decoder-only transformer [42]:
an embedding layer followed by _𝐿_ identical blocks, each
containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward network. Both sub-layers use residual connections [43], forming the _residual stream_ **𝐡** [(][𝓁][)] that flows through the network.
Modern variants apply RMSNorm before each sub-layer
(pre-norm) and rotary position embeddings (RoPE) [44].
During autoregressive generation, the KV cache stores key
and value vectors from previous steps to avoid _𝑂_ ( _𝑡_ [2] ) recomputation, requiring 2 ⋅ _𝐿_ ⋅ _𝑛_ kv ⋅ _𝑑_ head parameters per token.
Following the circuits framework [36], we treat the residual
stream as the primary object of computation: attention heads
and MLPs read from and write to this stream, and every
intermediate quantity is a function of **𝐡** [(][𝓁][)] at the relevant
layer.
This section formalises the claim that the KV cache carries no information beyond the residual stream. We state the
Markov property, derive reconstruction identities, analyse

inference scheme built on these results.


**3.1.** **The Residual Markov Property**
We first define the normalisation used throughout. For a
vector **𝐱** ∈ ℝ _[𝑑]_, RMSNorm computes



**𝐱**
RMSNorm( **𝐱** ) = _⊙_ _**𝜸**_ _,_ (1)
‖ **𝐱** ‖RMS



√
‖ **𝐱** ‖RMS =



1 ~~∑~~ _𝑑_
_𝑑_ _𝑖_ =1 _[𝑥]_ _𝑖_ [2] _[,]_ (2)



where _**𝜸**_ ∈ ℝ _[𝑑]_ is a learned scale vector frozen at inference
time. Unlike LayerNorm, RMSNorm omits mean-centering,
making it a positive-homogeneous function of degree zero:
RMSNorm( _𝛼_ **𝐱** ) = RMSNorm( **𝐱** ) for any _𝛼>_ 0.


**Definition 3.1** (Residual Markov Property) **.** Let **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] denote
the residual stream at layer 𝓁 and position _𝑝_ . The transformer
satisfies the **residual** **Markov** **property** **at** **layer** 𝓁 if the
output distribution over next tokens is fully determined by
the collection { **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] ∶ _𝑝_ = 1 _,_ … _, 𝑡_ }, independent of how that
state was produced.


_Derivation._ Consider layer 𝓁 of a pre-norm transformer.
Let _[̄]_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] = RMSNorm( **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][)][ denote the normalised residual.]
The attention sub-layer first computes, for each head _ℎ_ ∈
{1 _,_ … _, 𝑛ℎ_ },

**𝐐** [(] _𝑝_ _[ℎ]_ [)] = RoPE [(] _[̄]_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] _,_ _𝑝_ [)] _,_ (3)

**𝐊** [(] _𝑗_ _[ℎ]_ [)] = RoPE [(] _[̄]_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑗_ [𝓁][)] **𝐖** [(] _𝑘_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] _,_ _𝑗_ [)] _,_ (4)

**𝐕** [(] _𝑗_ _[ℎ]_ [)] = _[̄]_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑗_ [𝓁][)] **𝐖** [(] _𝑣_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] _,_ (5)


where **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] _,_ **𝐖** [(] _𝑘_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] _,_ **𝐖** [(] _𝑣_ [𝓁] _[,ℎ]_ [)] are frozen weight matrices
mapping ℝ _[𝑑]_ [hidden] → ℝ _[𝑑]_ [head], and RoPE is a deterministic
position-dependent rotation defined in Section 3.2. The
attention output at position _𝑝_ for head _ℎ_ is

**Proposition** **3.1** (Residual Sufficiency) **.** For a pre-norm
transformer with _𝐿_ layers, the output distribution _𝑝_ ( _𝑥𝑡_ +1 ∣
_𝑥_ ≤ _𝑡_ ) is a deterministic function of { **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][}] _[𝑡]_ _𝑝_ =1 [for] [any] [𝓁] [∈]
{0 _,_ 1 _,_ … _, 𝐿_ }. It follows that the KV cache carries zero
additional information:

**3.2.** **KV Reconstruction from the Residual Stream**
_Rotary_ _position_ _encoding._ RoPE encodes position _𝑝_ by
rotating consecutive pairs of the projected vector. For **𝐱** ∈
ℝ _[𝑑]_ [head] :


RoPE( **𝐱** _, 𝑝_ )2 _𝑖_ −1 = _𝑥_ 2 _𝑖_ −1 cos _𝜃𝑖_ [(] _[𝑝]_ [)]

       - _𝑥_ 2 _𝑖_ sin _𝜃𝑖_ [(] _[𝑝]_ [)] _[,]_ (11)

RoPE( **𝐱** _, 𝑝_ )2 _𝑖_ = _𝑥_ 2 _𝑖_ −1 sin _𝜃𝑖_ [(] _[𝑝]_ [)]
+ _𝑥_ 2 _𝑖_ cos _𝜃𝑖_ [(] _[𝑝]_ [)] _[,]_ (12)


where _𝜃𝑖_ [(] _[𝑝]_ [)] = _𝑝_ ⋅ _𝑏_ [−2] _[𝑖]_ [∕] _[𝑑]_ [head] and _𝑏_ is a fixed base (typically
10 _,_ 000). In matrix form, RoPE( **𝐱** _, 𝑝_ ) = **𝐑** _𝑝_ **𝐱**, where **𝐑** _𝑝_ ∈
ℝ _[𝑑]_ [head][×] _[𝑑]_ [head] is an orthogonal block-diagonal rotation matrix
satisfying **𝐑** _[⊤]_ _𝑝_ **[𝐑]** _[𝑝]_ [=] **[ 𝐈]** [. The key property for reconstruction is]
that **𝐑** _𝑝_ is a deterministic function of the absolute position
index _𝑝_ alone.


_Reconstruction_ _identity._ The KV cache stores **𝐊** [(][𝓁][)] and
**𝐕** [(][𝓁][)] for every past token at every layer. Using the notation
_̄_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] = RMSNorm( **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][)][ from Section][ 3.1][, the cached entries]
can be reconstructed exactly:


**𝐊** [(] recon [𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ [=] **[ 𝐑]** _[𝑝]_ _[̄]_ **[𝐡]** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] **𝐖** [(] _𝑘_ [𝓁][)] _[,]_ (13)

**𝐕** [(] recon [𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ [=] _[ ̄]_ **[𝐡]** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] **𝐖** [(] _𝑣_ [𝓁][)] _[.]_ (14)


The value projection in (14) involves no positional encoding
and holds universally across all architectures.


**Proposition** **3.2** (Exact KV Reconstruction) **.** For any fullattention layer 𝓁 using absolute RoPE, the cached and reconstructed KV entries are identical:


**𝐊** [(] cached [𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ [≡] **[𝐊]** recon [(][𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ _[,]_

**𝐕** [(] cached [𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ [≡] **[𝐕]** recon [(][𝓁][)] _, 𝑝_ _[,]_ (15)


for all positions _𝑝_ and layers 𝓁. The reconstruction error is
exactly zero, not approximately.


_Proof._ Both the cached and reconstructed paths apply the
same sequence of deterministic operations to **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][:] [RM-]
SNorm (1), linear projection ( **𝐖** [(] _𝑘_ [𝓁][)] or **𝐖** [(] _𝑣_ [𝓁][)][),] [and] [for] [keys,]
rotation **𝐑** _𝑝_ at absolute position _𝑝_ (11)–(12). All parameters
are frozen at inference. The two computation paths are algebraically identical, yielding zero error under any floatingpoint precision that preserves operation ordering.

Every operation in (3)–(9) takes the set { **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][}] _[𝑡]_ _𝑝_ =1 [as] [input]
and uses only frozen parameters. The final token distribution
is _𝑝_ ( _𝑥𝑡_ +1) = softmax( **𝐡** [(] _𝑡_ _[𝐿]_ [)] **𝐖** vocab). By induction over layers

**Figure** **1:** Three inference regimes compared. **(Left)** Standard KV cache: stores all K/V pairs, memory grows as _𝑂_ ( _𝑇_ ) with
sequence length. **(Centre)** Sliding window eviction: bounds memory to the last _𝐵_ tokens but permanently discards evicted KV
entries, yielding 5–28% token match and high KL divergence. **(Right)** KV-Direct: evicted KV entries are replaced by residual
stream checkpoints (5 KB/token for Gemma3-4B), from which exact K and V are recomputed on the fly, achieving bounded
memory with 100% token match and _𝐷_ KL ≈0.



_Sliding-window_ _boundary._ In sliding-window attention,
the key at position _𝑗_ within a window starting at offset _𝑤_
is rotated by **𝐑** _𝑗_ - _𝑤_ rather than **𝐑** _𝑗_ . Reconstruction from the
residual uses absolute position _𝑗_, producing a mismatch:

‖ **𝐊** recon − **𝐊** cached‖ = ‖( **𝐑** _𝑗_   - **𝐑** _𝑗_   - _𝑤_ ) _[̄]_ **𝐡** [(] _𝑗_ [𝓁][)] **[𝐖]** [(] _𝑘_ [𝓁][)][‖] _[,]_ [(16)]

which is non-zero whenever _𝑤_ ≠ 0. Value reconstruction is
unaffected because **𝐕** involves no rotation. On Gemma 34B-IT, this boundary affects 29 of 34 layers (the slidingwindow layers), while all 5 global-attention layers satisfy
Proposition 3.2 exactly.


**Corollary 3.3** (Zero Conditional Entropy) **.** Since the mapping **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] ↦ ( **𝐊** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] _[,]_ **[ 𝐕]** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)][)] [is] [deterministic] [for] [full-attention]
layers,

_𝐻_ [(] **𝐊** [(][𝓁][)] _,_ **𝐕** [(][𝓁][)] ∣ **𝐡** [(][𝓁][)][)] = 0 ∀ 𝓁 _._ (17)


The mutual information equals the full entropy of the cache:
_𝐼_ ( **𝐊** [(][𝓁][)] _,_ **𝐕** [(][𝓁][)] ; **𝐡** [(][𝓁][)] ) = _𝐻_ ( **𝐊** [(][𝓁][)] _,_ **𝐕** [(][𝓁][)] ). The residual stream
captures the complete information content of the KV cache.


**3.3.** **Bilinear Attention Form and Effective Rank**
In standard scaled dot-product attention, the score between query position _𝑖_ and key position _𝑗_ at head _ℎ_ can be
written as a bilinear form over the residual stream:



_⊤_

where **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] = **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ _[ℎ]_ [)] **[𝐖]** [(] _𝑘_ _[ℎ]_ [)] ∈ ℝ _𝑑_ hidden× _𝑑_ hidden and we omit

RMSNorm and RoPE for clarity. The matrix **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] determines which directions in the residual stream produce high
attention scores.
Architecturally, rank( **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] ) ≤ _𝑑_ head because both **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ _[ℎ]_ [)]

When _𝑟_ [∗] (0 _._ 9) _≪𝑑_ head, the attention computation concentrates along a small number of spectral directions. This
provides a geometric account of why eviction methods that
select tokens by attention score [1] can preserve generation
quality: residual components along low-energy singular directions contribute minimally to the attention pattern.


**3.4.** **KV-Direct: Bounded Inference via Residual**
**Checkpointing**
The preceding identities suggest replacing the KV cache
with residual checkpoints and on-the-fly recomputation. We
propose KV-Direct, summarised in Algorithm 1. When a
token’s KV entry is evicted from the cache, we retain its
residual vector **𝐡** [(] _𝑝_ [𝓁][)] (a single vector of dimension _𝑑_ hidden) and
recompute **𝐊** and **𝐕** when the token is needed for attention.
The cost is one matrix multiply plus a normalisation per
evicted token per layer.


_Per-token_ _memory._ For a model with _𝐿_ layers, _𝑛_ kv KV
heads, head dimension _𝑑_ head, and _𝑏_ bytes per element, the
standard KV cache stores


KV per token = 2 _𝐿𝑛_ kv _𝑑_ head _𝑏_ bytes _,_ (23)


while the residual checkpoint costs only


Residual per token = _𝑑_ hidden ⋅ _𝑏_ bytes _._ (24)

A single residual vector serves _all 𝐿_ layers; downstream **𝐊**
and **𝐕** at any depth can be recomputed from it. The per-token
compression ratio is


_[𝑑]_ [head]
_𝜌_ = [2] _[ 𝐿𝑛]_ [kv] _._ (25)

_𝑑_ hidden

For Gemma 3-4B-IT with _𝐿_ =34, _𝑛_ kv=4, _𝑑_ head=256, and
_𝑏_ =2 (bfloat16): the KV cost is 2×34×4×256×2 = 139 _,_ 264
bytes ≈136 KB per token, versus 2560 × 2 = 5 _,_ 120 bytes
= 5 KB for the residual ( _𝜌_ = 27 _._ 2).



_Recomputation_ _cost._ Reconstructing K and V for _𝑁_
evicted tokens at a single layer requires two matrix multiplications of shape ( _𝑁, 𝑑_ hidden) × ( _𝑑_ hidden _, 𝑑_ head) per KV head,
plus _𝑁_ RMSNorm and _𝑁_ RoPE operations. The dominant
cost in floating-point operations is


_𝐶_ recomp = 4 _𝑁_ ⋅ _𝑛_ kv ⋅ _𝑑_ hidden ⋅ _𝑑_ head _,_ (26)


where the factor of 4 accounts for two projections (K and
V), each costing 2 _𝑁𝑑_ hidden _𝑑_ head multiply-add operations per
head. By contrast, reading _𝑁_ cached KV entries transfers


_𝐵_ read = 2 _𝑁_ ⋅ _𝑛_ kv ⋅ _𝑑_ head ⋅ _𝑏_ bytes (27)


over the memory bus. Whether recomputation or cache
reading is faster depends on the hardware’s compute-tobandwidth ratio (arithmetic intensity), which we measure
empirically in Section 5.8.


_Total_ _memory_ _bound._ For a sequence of _𝑇_ tokens with
cache budget _𝐵_, KV-Direct stores _𝐵_ recent KV entries per
layer and checkpoints the remaining _𝑇_ - _𝐵_ residuals (shared
across all layers). The total memory is


( _𝑇, 𝐵_ ) = 2 _𝐵𝐿𝑛_ kv _𝑑_ head _𝑏_

+ ( _𝑇_          - _𝐵_ ) _𝑑_ hidden _𝑏._ (28)


Unbounded caching costs _𝑇_ ⋅ 2 _𝐿𝑛_ kv _𝑑_ head _𝑏_, growing _𝜌_ times
faster in _𝑇_ . For any fixed budget _𝐵_, KV-Direct memory
grows at rate _𝑑_ hidden ⋅ _𝑏_ per token regardless of model depth
or head count.


**4.** **Experiments**


To systematically investigate the redundancy hypothesis, we organise the experimental evaluation around four
research questions:

RQ1 Can K and V tensors at every layer be exactly reconstructed from residual stream vectors across different
architectures, precisions, and sequence lengths?

RQ2 Does the residual stream at any given layer constitute
a sufficient statistic for all subsequent computations in transformer inference?

RQ3 Can residual checkpointing with aggressive memory
budgets match the output fidelity of unbounded KV caching,
and how does this compare to existing eviction strategies?

RQ4 At what point does recomputing K and V from checkpointed residuals become faster than reading cached tensors
from memory?
We test each component on six models spanning four
architecture families, from 135M to 4B parameters. All
experiments run on Apple M3 Max (64 GB unified memory)
using the MLX framework with bfloat16 precision. Table 1
summarises the model architectures and per-token memory
costs. The theoretical compression ratio _𝜌_ (25) ranges from
6 _._ 9× (Qwen2.5-0.5B, 2 KV heads) to 56× (Qwen3-0.6B,
8 KV heads), demonstrating that the memory advantage of
residual checkpointing grows with the product _𝐿_ ⋅ _𝑛_ kv ⋅ _𝑑_ head
relative to _𝑑_ hidden.

**4.1.** **Baselines**
For RQ1–RQ2, we compare against full recomputation
from scratch (no cache) and standard KV-cached decoding. For RQ3, we benchmark KV-Direct against five prevalent cache eviction strategies: H2O [1], StreamingLLM [8],
SnapKV [9], TOVA [10], and window-only eviction. We
evaluate on two models (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct 4-bit and
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct 4-bit) across five cache budgets from
32 to 384 tokens out of a 512-token context, generating 50
tokens per passage over 5 diverse prompts. For RQ4, we
measure recomputation latency against memory-bus copy of
cached tensors across batch sizes from 1 to 500 tokens. All
experiments use greedy (argmax) decoding unless otherwise
noted.


**5.** **Results**


**5.1.** **KV Reconstruction Verification (RQ1)**
We verify (13)–(14) by direct computation. During a
forward pass we capture both the cached KV entries and
the residual stream **𝐡** [(][𝓁][)] entering each layer, then reconstruct
**𝐊** [(] recon [𝓁][)] [and] **[𝐕]** [(] recon [𝓁][)] [from] [the] [residual] [and] [compare] [element-]
wise.


_Results._ Table 2 reports the maximum absolute difference
across all layers for each model. Every full-attention architecture achieves _exact_ zero: not approximately, but bitidentically. This holds for both full-precision and 4-bit quantised models, confirming that quantisation does not break the
structural identity. For Gemma’s 29 sliding-window layers,
**𝐕** remains exactly zero (the value projection involves no
positional encoding), while **𝐊** shows non-zero error because
the window-relative RoPE offset diverges from the absolute
position (Eq. 16).


_Sequence-length_ _invariance._ We measure KV reconstruction error at sequence lengths {16 _,_ 32 _,_ 64 _,_ 128 _,_ 256}
tokens on SmolLM2-135M and Gemma 3-4B-IT. Both
max |Δ _𝐾_ | and max |Δ _𝑉_ | remain indistinguishable from
zero ( _<_ 10 [−17] ) at all lengths. This is expected: reconstruction is a per-token matrix multiplication at each layer, so its
correctness cannot depend on sequence length. Confirming

it empirically rules out subtle caching artefacts at short or
long contexts.


_Numerical_ _precision_ _invariance._ We repeat the reconstruction under four dtype regimes: native bfloat16, float32,
float16, and explicit bfloat16 cast. In all cases max |Δ _𝐾_ | =
max |Δ _𝑉_ | = 0 exactly, confirming that the result reflects the
algebraic identity **𝐕** cached ≡ RMSNorm( **𝐡** ) **𝐖** _𝑣_ rather than a
numerical coincidence of a particular precision.


**5.2.** **Token-Identical Generation (RQ1)**
Reconstruction from residuals alone does not rule out
subtle state-accumulation effects in the autoregressive loop.
We test this by generating 30 tokens two ways on all six
models: **Method** **A** uses standard KV-cached decoding;
**Method** **B** feeds the entire sequence from scratch at every
step, with no cache. Both use greedy (argmax) decoding.
Table 3 shows the result. All six models produce 30/30
token-identical output under both methods. Method B is 1 _._ 7–
3 _._ 8× slower due to _𝑂_ ( _𝑛_ [2] ) recomputation, but produces the
same tokens from the same logit values. The cache is a speed
optimisation and nothing more.


**5.3.** **Cross-Task Residual Patching (RQ2)**
We test whether the residual stream encodes the _full_
computational state, not just KV entries. Following Geiger
et al. [40] and Conmy et al. [41], we perform activation

patching: a donor prompt (“What is the capital of Australia?”) and a recipient prompt (“What language is spoken
in France?”) are each run through SmolLM2-135M. At each
layer 𝓁 ∈{0 _,_ … _,_ 29}, we replace the recipient’s residual
with the donor’s and continue the forward pass.( )
The result is _𝐷_ KL _𝑝_ patched _𝑝_ donor = 0 _._ 0 at every layer:
‖
exactly zero, not approximately. The patched model outputs
“Canberra” (the donor answer) regardless of which layer we
inject at. We verified this across all 30 layers of SmolLM2135M and all 24 layers of Qwen2.5-0.5B: _𝐷_ KL = 0 at every
injection point, with zero exceptions. The residual stream is
a complete Markov state at every depth of the network.


**Remark 5.1.** This zero-KL result is exact because the same
model weights process the continuation. The residual stream
determines all subsequent computation; there is nowhere
else for information to reside.


**5.4.** **Downstream Task Evaluation (RQ2)**
While zero KL divergence guarantees identical output
distributions, we verify this parity empirically on standard
benchmarks. Table 4 reports results on 0-shot HellaSwag
( _𝑁_ =500) and WikiText-2 perplexity, where KV-Direct is independently measured via a separate layer-by-layer forward
pass that recomputes K and V from the residual stream at
each layer (cache=None), rather than copied from the fullcache baseline.
On HellaSwag, KV-Direct matches full-cache accuracy
exactly on all five standard-attention models with 100% prediction agreement, confirming that distribution-level equivalence translates to task-level equivalence. On WikiText-2
perplexity, KV-Direct achieves identical perplexity to full
caching across all models (e.g., 26.46 on SmolLM2-135M,
24.63 on Qwen2.5-0.5B), with zero numerical difference.
Window-only baselines degrade sharply: perplexity rises
from 38.2 at _𝐵_ =128 to 65.3 at _𝐵_ =64 and 135.4 at _𝐵_ =32.
This confirms that KV-Direct preserves complete model
quality regardless of cache budget, whereas naive eviction
destroys it.


_Sliding-window limitation._ On Gemma-3-4B (29/34 slidingwindow layers), the cache-free recompute path degrades dramatically: HellaSwag accuracy drops from 49.2% to 25.0%
(near random chance) and WikiText-2 perplexity diverges by

orders of magnitude. This occurs because sliding-window
layers require a rotating KV buffer to enforce windowrelative position encoding and local attention masking; a
simple cache-free recompute bypasses these constraints.
This result empirically confirms that KV-Direct in its current
form is limited to standard (global) attention layers, as noted
in Section 5.9.


**5.5.** **Memory and Multi-Turn Evaluation (RQ3)**
Figure 2 visualises the per-token memory ratio across all
six models. Storing one residual vector ( _𝑑_ hidden floats) costs
1 _._ 1–5 _._ 0 KB, while the corresponding KV pair (2 ⋅ _𝐿_ ⋅ _𝑛_ kv ⋅
_𝑑_ head floats) costs 12–136 KB. The ratio ranges from 6 _._ 9×
(Qwen2.5-0.5B, 2 KV heads) to 56× (Qwen3-0.6B, 8 KV
heads) and grows with the product _𝑛_ kv ⋅ _𝑑_ head relative to
_𝑑_ hidden.


_Multi-turn_ _experiment._ We ran a 20-turn conversation
benchmark bounding the cache to a 150 MB aggregated budget across different models. Figure 3 illustrates the memory
divergence. On smaller models scaling up to DS-R1-1.5B
(4.7× memory ratio), KV-Direct limits peak memory exactly
to the initial bounds without sacrificing latency, yielding an
extremely consistent 0 _._ 07–0 _._ 26s generation time matching
the unbounded baseline down to the millisecond.
Across the conversation benchmark, the conventional
unbounded cache steadily accrues megabytes (growing linearly), yet under KV-Direct, the cache limits perfectly bound
memory. Residual stream vectors act as scalable replacement
markers that trigger instantaneous rematerialisation on passthrough when necessary.

between the two directly encodes the memory inflation ratio (shown in red above each model).


**Figure** **3:** Multi-turn inference evaluation. **(a)** Memory growth over 20 conversation turns: standard KV cache grows to 103 MB
while KV-Direct stabilises at 42 MB. **(b)** Latency per turn: both methods track nearly identically, confirming zero inference penalty
from residual checkpointing. **(c)** Per-token memory across all six models: the KV cache costs 7–27× more than a single residual
checkpoint.



At the 12B-parameter scale [49], the divergence is more
dramatic: the standard cache reaches ∼978 MB over 20 turns
while a 150 MB KV-Direct budget maintains stable 4-second
turns versus 13 seconds under unbounded caching.


**5.6.** **Compression Baselines (RQ3)**
Figure 4 presents the full performance matrix across all
seven methods (five eviction baselines, KV-Direct, and full
cache) at five cache budgets on both evaluation models.
The gap between methods is large. KV-Direct achieves
100% token match and near-zero KL divergence ( _<_ 10 [−5] ) at
_every_ budget on both models, matching the full (unbounded)
KV cache exactly. All five eviction baselines, by contrast,
degrade severely even at the most generous budget ( _𝐵_ =384,
75% retention): token match ranges from 6% to 28% and KL
divergence from 7.5 to 14.1. The gap is not marginal; it spans
orders of magnitude on KL and 70–95 percentage points
on token match. At the most aggressive budget ( _𝐵_ =32,
6% retention), baselines produce essentially random output
while KV-Direct remains lossless.



_KV_ _budget_ _sweep._ We also isolate the effect of cache
window size without any eviction baseline. Holding only
the last _𝐵_ tokens in cache and evicting the rest without
recomputation, we measure token match on two models
across six window sizes ( _𝐵_ ∈{8 _,_ 16 _,_ 32 _,_ 64 _,_ 128 _,_ 256}) with
250-token generation. At _𝐵_ =256, Qwen2.5-0.5B recovers
88% of tokens while SmolLM2-135M recovers only 34%,
reflecting model-specific sensitivity to context truncation.
At the smallest window ( _𝐵_ =8), both models produce nearrandom output (0–2% match). With residual recomputation
enabled, KV-Direct recovers 100% match at every budget,
because evicted tokens are recomputed from residual checkpoints rather than discarded.


**5.7.** **Effective Rank Analysis (RQ4)**

_⊤_

We compute **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] = **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ _[ℎ]_ [)] **[𝐖]** [(] _𝑘_ _[ℎ]_ [)] for every attention head

in three models and measure effective rank from the singular
value spectrum. Figure 5 shows the result as a dual-encoded
dot matrix across all heads and layers: colour indicates the
fraction of architectural rank used at 90% spectral energy
(blue = low rank / highly compressible, red = near full rank),

while dot size encodes the same fraction as area. Dashed
outlines mark Gemma’s five global-attention layers.
The three architectures differ in head dimension ( _𝑑_ head =
64 vs. 256) but share a common pattern visible in Figure 5:
the mean effective rank at 90% energy is 27–33% of _𝑑_ head
(mean ranks of 21.2, 20.0, and 70.2 for SmolLM2, Qwen2.50.5B, and Gemma respectively), yielding 3 _._ 0–3 _._ 6× compression ratios. A long tail of near-rank-1 heads is present across
all models; on Gemma, 3 of 136 heads (2%) have effective
rank ≤ 10, including one rank-1 head at layer 0 consistent
with the attention-sink phenomenon.


_Low-rank_ _approximation_ _fails_ _at_ _generation._ Despite
the low effective rank, truncating the KV projections to
rank _𝑟_ _<_ _𝑑_ head destroys output quality. Figure 6 plots
token match and KL divergence against projection rank for



SmolLM2-135M and Qwen2.5-0.5B. At full rank ( _𝑟_ =64),
token match is 100% with _𝐷_ KL = 5 × 10 [−4] . At _𝑟_ =32
(50% of _𝑑_ head), match drops to 15% with _𝐷_ KL = 10 _._ 9.
Below _𝑟_ =15, output is essentially random (5–10% match,
_𝐷_ KL _>_ 11). The spectral energy captured by the top 32
components exceeds 95%, yet discarding the remaining 5%
of energy produces catastrophic output degradation. This
exposes a separation: the low-rank structure explains _why_
attention works (computation concentrates on a subspace),
but it cannot be exploited for lossy compression without
degrading generation. Lossless recomputation from the full
residual stream, as in KV-Direct, is the only approach that
preserves exact output fidelity.

**Figure** **5:** Effective rank of **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] = **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ _[ℎ]_ [)] **[𝐖]** _𝑘_ [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] at 90% spectral energy across three models. Each dot is one KV head at one layer.

**Colour** : rank as a fraction of _𝑑_ head (blue = compressible, red = near full rank). **Size** : same fraction (larger = higher rank). Dashed
outlines on Gemma mark global-attention layers. Layer 0 consistently shows near-rank-1 heads across all models, consistent with
the BOS-focus phenomenon [8]. Rank heterogeneity is visible both within and across architectures.



_Geometric_ _account_ _of_ _eviction_ _robustness._ This lowrank structure provides a geometric account of why tokenimportance eviction methods [1, 2] preserve generation
quality at moderate budgets: attention computation concentrates along a small subspace of the residual stream, so
tokens whose projections lie outside this subspace contribute
minimally to the attention pattern. Rank-based compression
is most effective when applied selectively to the near-rank-1
minority rather than uniformly across all heads.


**5.8.** **Recomputation Latency (RQ4)**
A primary assumption driving unbounded KV caches
is that recomputing state is invariably slower than reading
it from memory. To test this, we benchmarked the time
required to reconstruct _𝑁_ KV vectors from residual matrices
versus copying identical cached tensors over the memory
bus.
Figure 7 reveals a surprising crossover: memory bandwidth becomes the overriding bottleneck. For small batches
of evicted tokens ( _𝑁_ =1), recomputation holds a slight overhead (1 _._ 1× ratio). However, as _𝑁_ scales, dense matrix multiplication from residuals fully outstrips memory fetches. At
_𝑁_ =500, reconstructing the matrices from residuals operates



in roughly 0 _._ 2× to 0 _._ 3× the time required to read precomputed cache structures from memory. Checkpointing the
residual is not merely a memory optimization; for moderately sized token windows, it accelerates data delivery to the
attention compute units.
All five models cross below parity by _𝑁_ =50. At _𝑁_ =100,
ratios range from 0 _._ 46× (Qwen2.5-1.5B) to 0 _._ 68× (SmolLM2135M). At _𝑁_ =500, the largest model reconstructs KV
in 0 _._ 17× the time required to read cached tensors. The
crossover point scales with model size: larger models have
proportionally more compute per byte of cache, so recomputation amortises faster.


**5.9.** **Discussion**
Our results recast the KV cache as derived state. Serving systems [6] currently treat KV entries as irreplaceable, engineering memory allocation, garbage collection,
and CPU/disk swapping around them. Recognising KV as
recoverable from the residual stream turns the cache into
a true cache in the computer-science sense: a performance
optimisation that can be evicted and regenerated without loss
of correctness.
This shift has direct implications for edge deployment
and long conversations. On a memory-constrained device,

**Figure** **6:** Token match (%) and KL divergence vs. KV projection rank _𝑟_ on two models. At full rank ( _𝑟_ =64), both models achieve
100% match. Truncating to _𝑟_ =32 (50% of _𝑑_ head, capturing _>_ 95% spectral energy) causes catastrophic degradation: 5–15% match
and _𝐷_ KL _>_ 10. The shaded region marks ranks where lossy compression fails.


**6.** **Limitations and Future Work**



**Figure** **7:** Recompute-to-cache-read latency ratio across five
model architectures. Each curve traces one model as the
eviction batch size _𝑁_ increases from 1 to 500 tokens. The
teal-shaded region marks where recomputation is faster than
cache reading. All models cross below parity by _𝑁_ =50.


the KV cache is often the binding constraint on context
length; residual checkpointing relaxes it by trading compute
for memory. For long conversations, KV-Direct offers a third
option beyond truncation and unbounded growth: retain all
context in a fixed memory budget, recomputing KV for
evicted tokens as needed. Combined with attention sparsity
methods [1, 13], the recomputation cost drops in proportion
to the sparsity. The approach also composes naturally with
FlashAttention [33, 34], which optimises within a single
attention call while residual checkpointing optimises across
the sequence dimension.



Our experiments cover six models from 135M to 4B
parameters. The theoretical argument applies to any prenorm transformer with standard attention, but we have not
verified exact-zero reconstruction on models with LayerNorm (instead of RMSNorm), mixture-of-experts routing,
or parameters above 4B. On Gemma 3-4B-IT, cache-free
recompute degrades HellaSwag accuracy from 49.2% to
25.0% and perplexity by orders of magnitude, confirming that sliding-window architectures require position-aware
cache management that simple recompute does not provide
(Section 5.4). The multi-turn benchmark uses 20 turns; realworld deployment at 100K+ token contexts would face
additional recomputation latency.
The bounded inference prototype uses full recomputation (budget _𝐵_ =0), the extreme case. A practical system
would set _𝐵>_ 0, caching recent tokens and recomputing
only evicted entries. The optimal budget depends on the
hardware’s compute-to-memory bandwidth ratio, a systemlevel optimisation we leave to future work.
Several directions warrant investigation. First, integrating residual checkpointing into production serving frameworks (e.g., vLLM) to measure end-to-end throughput at
scale. Second, combining KV-Direct with weight quantisation and per-head mixed-precision caching guided by the
rank heterogeneity observed in Section 5.7. Third, extending
the Markov property analysis to architectures with crosslayer KV sharing [26, 27] and latent-space attention [29],
where the residual-to-KV mapping takes different algebraic
forms.


**7.** **Conclusion**


We have shown, through theory and experiment, that
the KV cache in transformer inference is a computational
shortcut, not an information store. Keys and values at every

layer are deterministic projections of the residual stream.
Removing the cache and recomputing from scratch produces
identical tokens. Replacing the residual stream wholesale at
any layer produces the donor’s output distribution with zero
KL divergence, confirming the Markov property.
The bilinear attention form reveals strong rank heterogeneity across heads and models. The mean effective rank
at 90% spectral energy is 27–33% of _𝑑_ head on all three
architectures tested, with a small subset ( _<_ 2%) of near-rank1 attention-sink heads. This structure motivates per-head
mixed-precision caching and provides a geometric account
of why token-eviction heuristics preserve generation quality.
These results reframe KV cache management. Instead
of designing eviction policies that try to preserve the “most
important” cached entries, we can treat the residual stream as
ground truth and recompute KV entries as needed. Memory
becomes a tunable knob: more cache means faster inference,
less cache means lower memory, but correctness is guaranteed regardless. For memory-constrained settings (edge
devices, long conversations, high-concurrency serving), this
guarantee changes what is possible.

**A.** **Experimental Details**

_Hardware._ All experiments were run on an Apple M3 Max
with 64 GB unified memory. We use the MLX framework
for model loading and inference, with bfloat16 precision
throughout.


_Models._




 - **SmolLM2-135M-Instruct** [45]: LLaMA-family, 30
layers, _𝑑_ hidden = 576, 9 query heads, 3 KV heads,
_𝑑_ head = 64.

 - **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** [46]: Qwen2, 24 layers, _𝑑_ hidden =
896, 14 query heads, 2 KV heads, _𝑑_ head = 64. 4-bit
quantised.


 - **Qwen3-0.6B-Base** : Qwen3, 28 layers, _𝑑_ hidden = 1024,
16 query heads, 8 KV heads, _𝑑_ head = 128. Full precision.


 - **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B** [47]: Qwen2 architecture (reasoning-distilled), 28 layers, _𝑑_ hidden = 1536,
12 query heads, 2 KV heads, _𝑑_ head = 128.

 - **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** : Qwen2, 28 layers, _𝑑_ hidden =
1536, 12 query heads, 2 KV heads, _𝑑_ head = 128. 4-bit
quantised.


 - **Gemma** **3-4B-IT** [48]: Gemma3, 34 layers, _𝑑_ hidden =
2560, 8 query heads, 4 KV heads, _𝑑_ head = 256. 29/34
sliding window; 5 global. 4-bit quantised.
All models use pre-norm (RMSNorm) and RoPE. Experiments run on Apple M3 Max via MLX with bfloat16
precision.


_Prompts._ For Experiment 1 (KV reconstruction): “The
residual stream in a transformer is the central information
highway. All attention and MLP outputs are additive updates
to it.” (24 tokens after tokenization.)
For Experiment 2 (generation match): “Explain why the
sky is blue in simple terms.” Greedy (argmax) decoding with
no temperature or sampling.
For Experiment 3 (multi-turn): System prompt “You are
a helpful, concise AI assistant.” followed by user turns about
France, the Eiffel Tower, etc. 30 tokens generated per turn.



_Rank computation._ The bilinear form **𝐌** [(] _[ℎ]_ [)] = **𝐖** [(] _𝑞_ _[ℎ]_ [)] **[𝐖]** [(] _𝑘_ _[ℎ]_ [)]



_⊤_



was computed in float32 to avoid precision loss. Singular
values were obtained via numpy.linalg.svd. Effective rank
was defined as the smallest _𝑟_ such that [∑] _𝑖_ _[𝑟]_ =1 _[𝜎]_ _𝑖_ [2] [≥] [0] _[.]_ [90] [⋅]
∑ _𝑑_ head
_𝑖_ =1 _[𝜎]_ _𝑖_ [2][.]



**B.** **Additional Analysis**


This section presents two supplementary analyses that
complement the main results. Figure 9 examines how token match degrades under window-only caching as the KV
budget varies, confirming that KV-Direct maintains lossless
reconstruction at all budget levels. Figure 8 visualises the
cross-task residual patching experiment across all layers and
models, providing layer-granularity evidence for the Markov
property established in Section 3.1.

The Residual Stream Is All You Need


**Figure** **8:** Cross-task residual patching across all layers for four models. Each block represents one layer where the recipient’s
residual stream is replaced with the donor’s. All tested layers produce _𝐷_ KL = 0 _._ 0 across all four architectures, confirming that the
residual stream is a sufficient Markov state at every depth.


**Figure** **9:** KV budget sweep across six window sizes
( _𝐵_ ∈{8 _,_ 16 _,_ 32 _,_ 64 _,_ 128 _,_ 256}) with 250-token generation. (a)
Window-only token match degrades sharply as the cache
budget shrinks, while KV-Direct maintains 100% match at all
budgets. (b) Averaged across budgets, window-only caching
achieves 16–23% match versus KV-Direct’s perfect recovery.
